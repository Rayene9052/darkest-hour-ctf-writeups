The description of the challenge might not help much by saying 'somewhere out there'. However all  you have to do here is to look for the secreenshot in the blog we found in the previous challenge. By clicking the user's account >> about you'll find the secreenshot which shows the car plate

The next step is to go to this website (https://immatriculation-auto.info/en) and put the car plate number there and it will show you all the info you need for the flag
