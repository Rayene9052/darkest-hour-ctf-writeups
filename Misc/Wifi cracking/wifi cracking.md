# Wifi cracking
## Description

Love is in the air, well, litterally. Can you crack this wifi (ssid=love)? Flag format: Securinets{wifi_password} 
Important note: for this task, you'll need a wifi USB interface to connect to your linux VM. You can request one from the technical team and have it for 30 minutes for testing. This is the link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18JupMl8v-DC45eHiSvC0W_6XjoDTNEm7eOuP79vbty4/edit?usp=sharing, just add your team name and time. (You should come to the authors desks to claim it) Please respect others and don't remove entries. Thanks for understanding and goodluck.
